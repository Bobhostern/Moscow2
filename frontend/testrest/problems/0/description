"Mr. Schniggles, your beloved cat, is stuck in a burning building! Fortunately, you live in Numberville, where everyone is a number. Your close friend, the number 6, courageously runs into the building with number 7 in close pursuit (to eat him, maybe?). They safely retrieve Mr. Schniggles, but 7 trips and falls into 6 (likely intentionally) as they leave the building! As this is Numberville, the collision of two numbers unavoidably results in their addition, and so 13 pops out with Mr. Schniggles in hand. Nobody is quite sure what happens to the two original numbers."
