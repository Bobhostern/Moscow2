"This competition uses the Moscow platform. In order for it to work properly, you may need to use <a href=\"http://google.com/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> as your web browser as opposed to Internet Explorer or Safari. The sideways lines at the top left when clicked will open a navigation menu which will take you to different pages. At the top right, there are two dropdown menus, the one on the left being the contest information, quick links, and message previews and the one on the right being the user information/settings. Have fun!"
